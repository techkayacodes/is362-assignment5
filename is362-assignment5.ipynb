The findings should be validated with additional research.\n# - **Windiest Airport on February 12th, 2013:** The windiest airport is identified based on average wind speed, with potential outliers and data inaccuracies considered in the analysis.\n\n# MARKDOWN CELL:\n# ## Conclusion\n# This notebook provides an analysis to identify the northernmost and easternmost airports in the United States and the windiest New York area airport on February 12th, 2013.
